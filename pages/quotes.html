                                <li>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants - <small><i>Isaac Newton</i></small></li>
                                <li>People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware - <small><i>Alan Kay</i></small></li>
                                <li>The best way to predict the future is to invent it - <small><i>Alan Kay</i></small></li>
                                <li>Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships - <small><i>Linus Torvalds</i></small></li>
                                <li>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things - <small><i>Steve Jobs</i></small></li>
                                <li>There is a difference between a movie star and a character actor, movie star is more aware how to do a look to make the viewer feel like I want to be that person whereas the character actor is there to make us forget we're watching a film - <small><i>OffCamera interview</i></small></li>
                                <li>Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy - <small><i>Naval</i></small></li>
                                <li>Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth - <small><i>Marcus Aurelius</i></small></li>
                                <li>What I cannot create, I do not understand - <small><i>Richard Feynman</i></small></li>
