                            <p>
                                When it comes to tv/web series I like mini-series or series with few seasons, mostly with Mystery/Thriller/Crime genre.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am not saying long TV series are bad, but Drama Series with more than 2-3 season will hook you on with its story line, and you will want to see the rest of 
                                all the seasons, which will waste a lot of your time, but in the end you will appreciate a story with lots of side missions which are deviated from the main story line just to fill in time.
                                Eg. Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, How I met your mother, Suits, The Office, Prison Break, etc.
                            </p>

                                Also regarding japanese anime series such as:
                                Death Note, which is good, I have watched a couple of others like Code Geass, Steins gate, Detective conan, etc.
                                Although I appreciate the creativity, fantasy, sci-fi and unique perspective of them, not to mention huge fan base online.
                                I personally don't like them, beacuse of reasons:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They are long, 100s of episodes</li>
                                    <li>They are usually repeatative episode after episode</li>
                                    <li>Its contained in itself with no relation to outside world</li>
                                    <li>You forget the story after a while the series gets over, its not long lasting</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
