                            <p>
                                I am a huge fan of open-source software, for the sole reason that they actually care
                                about user privacy and are transparent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for all other reasons (quality, output, ease of usage, free/paid, cross-platform,
                                etc) are similar in both open source and proprietary software.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We always have a choice of software when trying to do do something, but I believe this
                                choice is getting harder day-by-day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just see how many apps are there in Play store/App store? there are tons. How many of
                                them are good to use, free, and without ads/in-app purchase? not so much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not to mention the privacy permissions required by these apps are unbelievable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It isn't about open-source vs proprietary software, it is about a software product which
                                does what user expects it to do without anything else which user didn't ask for. Right
                                thing would be to have a careful combination of both in your pallete without
                                compromising much of your data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Due to these reasons, I tend to use desktop apps/websites more than my smartphone apps.
                            </p>

                                Below is the list (non-exhaustive) of some softwares which I personally use and
                                recommend:
