                                It was long back when I had thought of having my own website. At that time the only name you could hear was Wordpress, I had tried that but I didn't like it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then there was Google blogspot, I had created a website on it, and was using it for my notes reference during college, then I had come across github pages where we can host a static website for free from our repository, how cool is that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then after looking for other people blogs and portfolio, I came to know about Jekyll themes as it had good compatibility with github pages, I gave it a shot and used it for about a year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still something was missing, I had promised myself that I will be posting my blogs regularly on it, but I didn't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A friend of my was into web development, I had asked him to suggest me some good web framework he had suggested Vue, React and Angular. After doing our usual comparision online I decided to go with React.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was good, I created another version of my website using React and hosted on github pages, it was with those fancy Bootstrap components that changed according to device screen, I used that for a year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The issue I faced with React website was that its node dependencies were getting deprecated quickly and github was asking me quite frequently to update the versions of dependencies, after getting frustated I decided to create another version of my personal website using Angular.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one was by far the best version of my personal website yet, individual components with good management and deployment flow, but still I hadn't started my blog writing, it was just a static website decribing myself, my project and resume, I decided to have a minimal website which I can edit to the core with simple edit and deployment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then I created this present version which you are seeing, I just contains .html and .css and images, no javascript.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This website works on all browsers on all devices, and is light on computer resources. If you want to read some rant about a lightweight website here is a <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">link</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am thinking of owning a domain and hosting my site on a hosting server, but github pages have been good so far.
